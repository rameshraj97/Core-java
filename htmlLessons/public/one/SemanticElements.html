	<strong> The &lt nav &gt HTML element represents a section of
		a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the
		current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation
		sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes. <a
		href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav">
			nav Url </a>
	</strong>
	<nav>
		<ol>
			<li class="crumb"><a href="home.html">Home</a></li>
			<li class="crumb"><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
			<li class="crumb"><a href="about">About</a></li>
			</li>
	</nav>
	<strong> The &lt main &gt HTML element represents the dominant
		content of the &lt body &gt of a document. The main content area
		consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the
		central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an
		application. </strong>
	<main>
		<header>
			<h2>Gecko facts</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Geckos are a group of usually small, usually nocturnal lizards.
			They are found on every continent except Australia.</p>
		<p>Many species of gecko have adhesive toe pads which enable them
			to climb walls and even windows.</p>
	</main>
	<strong> The &lt section &gt HTML element represents a generic
		standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific
		semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a
		heading, with very few exceptions. <a
		href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/HTML/Element/section">Url</a>
	</strong>
	<hr />
	<section>

	<strong> The &lt article &gt HTML element represents a
		self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site,
		which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g.,
		in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or
		newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted
		comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent
		item of content. </strong>
	<strong> The &lt header &gt element defines a banner landmark
		when its context is the &lt body &gt element. The HTML header element
		is not considered a banner landmark when it is descendant of an &lt
		article &gt, &lt aside &gt, &lt main, &lt nav &gt, or &lt section &gt
		element. </strong>
